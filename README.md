# Cradle

**Welcome to Cradle: White Eye Detector**

**Cradle is Facebook-integrated web app built by [Chris Katzmann](http://www.github.com/cwkatzmann) and  [Tim Chew](http://www.github.com/timothyrchew) in the course of a week.**

This project originated from an opportunity to partner with a [Baylor data scientists](http://cs.baylor.edu/~hamerly/leuko/) to incorperate a machine learning algorithm into a Facebook app. 

Our app helps parents detect the appearance of white eye in pictures of their children. White eye can be a symptom of multiple serious eye diseases such as retinoblastoma, pediatric cataract, and Coats' disease. These diseases are often first detected by parents because the parent notices white eye in pictures of their children. This app will find pictures in your Facebook account that have white eye, and will show you these pictures so that you can inspect them for yourself.

Cradle was built on the following technologies:
* Node.js
* Express
* AngularJS
* PostgreSQL
<hr>

### Challenges we faced:

* This was our first application built in Angular. While the rest of our class was working through the Angular curriculum, we opted to venture out on our own with a real world project. We learned to love the Angular documentation and had many opportunities to hone our Google skills.

*(TODO) We learned to work with the Facebook Graph API to gain user's persmision to access their account info and photos. 

* (Contructing a test environment while we waited for the detection algorythm)

### Other technologies used for this project:
* **[Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/)** - to help with page styling
* **[Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)** - used as SQL query builder
* **[Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/)** - Facebook OAuth

# Cradle Walkthrough:
<br>
##  1. Create a Sprint 

<br>
<br>

<br>
* Name your Sprint.
* Pick a start and end date for your Sprint. 
* Designate the productive websites you would like to track during the course of your Sprint. 
* If you would like to up the stakes, designate your Sprint as a cash game. This will require all players to contribute to a cash pot (through Dwolla). The winner of the Sprint takes home the pot.

##  2. Invite Your Friends

<br>
* Players can join existing games as long as they have the unique game code that Sprintr generates for each Sprint. 
* If the Sprint is a cash game, players will be authenticated through Dwolla and their Dwolla account will be connected to the Sprint.
<br><br><br><br>


##  3. Download the Chrome Extension

<br><br>

<br>
* Anyone who has downloaded the extension can log in right on the extension popup itself.
* Players can view Sprintr game stats directly from the extension for any competition they're a part of.

<br>
* Sprintr's web portal generates a more detailed view for all games a player is a part of.
* The player's dashboard page lists stats for all current games.

<br>
* The game's leaderboard page shows individualized stats as a donut chart as well as a chart that displays players' game rankings and the countdown to the end of the game.
