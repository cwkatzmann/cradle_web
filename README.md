# Cradle

**Welcome to Cradle: White Eye Detector**

**Cradle is Facebook-integrated web app built by [Chris Katzmann](http://www.github.com/cwkatzmann) and  [Tim Chew](http://www.github.com/timothyrchew) in the course of a week.**

This project originated from an opportunity to partner with a [Baylor data scientists](http://cs.baylor.edu/~hamerly/leuko/) to incorperate a machine learning algorithm into a Facebook app. 

Our app helps parents detect the appearance of white eye in pictures of their children. White eye can be a symptom of multiple serious eye diseases such as retinoblastoma, pediatric cataract, and Coats' disease. These diseases are often first detected by parents because the parent notices white eye in pictures of their children. This app will find pictures in your Facebook account that have white eye, and will show you these pictures so that you can inspect them for yourself.

Cradle was built on the following technologies:
* Node.js
* Express
* AngularJS
* PostgreSQL

### Our Process

Throughout our Galvanize cohort we have learned to love **pair programming**. Over the course of a week to build this project, we (Tim and Chris) worked exclusively on one screen. We consistently experienced the value of working together as a way to avoid both small syntax errors and bigger hurrdles of working in unfamiliar environemtns. The practice of verbalizing our thought process and collaborative problem-solving increased both the clarity of our code and the speed of our development time.

### Challenges we faced:

* This was our first application built in Angular. While the rest of our class was working through the Angular curriculum, we opted to venture out on our own with a real world project. We learned to love the Angular documentation and had many opportunities to hone our Google skills.

*(TODO) We learned to work with the Facebook Graph API to gain user's persmision to access their account info and photos.

### Other technologies used for this project:
* **[Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/)** - to help with page styling
* **[Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/)** - used as SQL query builder
* **[Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/)** - Facebook OAuth
